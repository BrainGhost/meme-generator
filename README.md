# **Meme generator😂**

> This application is designed in such a way that users can create their own memes😅 using images obtained via an API. Following the creation of the meme, the client can download and distribute it on other social media platforms. The app is developed with ReactJS, but it also makes use of Axios to retrieve images from the imgFlip API.

***`Star⭐ the Project if you like it 💻`***

> It is a simple meme generator that now allows anyone to make their own personalized meme with their own words.
